# Winter Internship & Hands-on Hardware Programme

## Overview

**Hands-on Hardware** is a programme as a part of Winter Internship, commenced from January 2024, from the Electrical Engineering Department at VJTI, aimed at providing students with practical experience in Embedded Systems and Robotics. The project covers essential skills from soldering to coding microcontrollers and working with sensors and motors.

## Introduction

This project is part of the **Winter Internship January 2024** at VJTI and aims to provide hands-on exposure to students across different years of study. It starts with the basics, such as understanding microcontrollers, communication protocols, and sensors, and gradually progresses to complex robotics applications. It demonstrates usage of PID Control System and its working.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To begin working with this project, you will need:
- An Arduino Uno or ESP32 microcontroller
- A computer with **Arduino IDE** installed
- Basic electronic components (resistors, LEDs, motors, sensors, etc.)
- A power supply (5V DC)

### Installation

1. Install **Arduino IDE** from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Install necessary libraries from the Arduino Library Manager.
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkt-1597/Winter-Internship-EED-Jan-2024.git
   ```
4. Connect your microcontroller and upload test sketches to verify setup.

## Hardware Components

### Microcontroller
- **Arduino Uno** (ATmega328P, 8-bit system, 16MHz)

### Sensors
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

### Actuators & Motors
- Servo Motors (MG996R)

## Tasks & Experiments

This repository contains various hands-on tasks, such as:

1. **Interfacing Sensors**
   - Ultrasonic sensor for distance calculation
2. **Motor Control with Arduino**
   - Interfacing Servo motor
3. **Advanced Robotics**
   - Combining sensors and actuators to create intelligent robotic systems
